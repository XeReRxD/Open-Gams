This project is a collection of games that have been uncopylocked. The repository associated with this project is used to preserve any games that are not stolen.

Anyone may suggest the addition of a game to this collection. This can be done on GitHub, by sending a pull request or filing an issue on the repository associated with this collection. This repository is owned by XeReRxD.

This collection includes pretty much any game, it's meant for archiving. Inappropiate games should not be submitted. One may legitimately use material (or fix it...) from any of these games in any project.

A catalog of the games is available in the file named catalog.md. (A TON of games are undocumented so far, sorry for the inconvenience!)
